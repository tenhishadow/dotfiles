# \e[100;96m -> bg:bright-black fg:cyan.

# "bg:238 fg:87" might be safer for specific colors.

# wait, the bashrc had "[ $output $branch ] " where output and branch were variables.

# Use format inside the module to wrap it.
# Bashrc: printf "\e[100;96m[ %s %s ]\e[0m "
# So brackets should be part of the styled output.
# I will put brackets in the format string.

# Wait, checking script output again:
# script: echo -n "${status_output}${branch}"
# status_output has space at end of each symbol? "⇡${ahead} "
# So it's "⇡1 branch".
# The bashrc used "%s %s" => "$status_output" "$branch"
# status_output in bashrc had trailing space?
# ((ahead > 0)) && status_output+="⇡${ahead} " -> Yes.
# So "⇡1 branch" is correct.
# And bashrc put brackets around it: "[ ⇡1 branch ]"
# So starship format: "[ [ $output ] ]($style) "
